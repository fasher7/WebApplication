      <h2><i> About Geralt </i></h2>

      <p>
        Geralt was born as the son of the sorceress a Visenna and presumably,
        the warrior Korin. Shortly after his birth, his mother left him with the
        School of the Wolf at the stronghold of Kaer Morhen. There, Geralt was
        made and trained to become a Witcher.
        <br />
        As a child, he was subjected to the Trial of The Grasses, he managed to
        survive the many blistering mutations required to grant Witcher's their
        abilities. After displaying unusual tolerance, Geralt was selected to
        further experimental mutations which granted him considerably greater
        strength, speed, endurance, resilience, healing, senses, complete
        immunity to diseases and conventional poisons, and extreme resistance to
        pain. This resulted in his hair turning white and received the nickname
        'White Wolf'.
        <br />
        Geralt was trained by his mentor
        <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Vesemir">Vesemir</a> whom he
        came to regard as a father-figure. He soon met his fellow classmate
        <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Eskel">Eskel</a> and the two
        became good friends and as close as brothers. One time, they captured a
        large forest bumblebee and tied it to a jug. The pair laughed at its
        antics until they were discovered by Vesemir who punished them with a
        leather strap.
